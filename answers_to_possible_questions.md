# Answers to Our Questions we Asked

### Does efficiency (exercises completed per minute) increase with time?
From plotting efficiency in exercises completed per hour vs hours of training for instructors 1, 3, and 4, it seems as though the opposite is actually true. Efficiency actually appears to decrease with time.

There may be additional factors as to why this happens other than the longer training times resulting in less effective training. For example, some exercises, warmup exercises in particular, will most likely take less time to complete than more precise training exercises that seek to train specific skills.

Of course, this cannot be finalized until we plot all graphs of this (assuming we choose to tackle this question) and create a report with this data in Excel.

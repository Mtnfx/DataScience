# STAA57 Project Proposal
`Avoid deleting other people's work when possible (anything in backticks is not final and can be deleted)`

### Analysis Plan
`Specify questions to be adressed`

`Describe data analysis plan`

### Data
`List/specify external data sources and types of data`
`R Code for importing data will not go  in this section (since it is 100+ lines ideally it goes in the appendix)`

### Preliminary Analysis
`Put in >= 3 graphs/DaVis' relating to analysis and comment on preliminary findings.`

### Appendix
`R Code for cleaning data goes here (I will put it in when I implement the last cleaning loop)`

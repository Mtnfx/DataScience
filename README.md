- Currently cleaning Excel data (fixing typos)
  - Double commas and periods have been fixed (thanks Excel find function)
  - Years have been fixed
  - One exercise set needs fixing (waiting for response from client)
  
- Currently analyzing data to check for potential correlations (This may potentially generate new questions or give better foundation for answering already existing questions)
  - Preliminary Excel analysis of instructors 1, 3, and 4 shows a fairly clear negative correlation between training time and efficiency. Unsure of whether this is causation or whether other factors may be the reason for correlation.

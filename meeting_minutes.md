## Meeting 2 - February 6th 2021 (8:00 - 8:40)

- Addressed minor error in data cleaning R script `Fixed`

- Discussion of efficency metrics
  - Duration by itself is not concrete enough to be an actual efficiency metric
  - `That being said, I have way too much free time, so I'll try to get an associated time for as many individual exercises as possible`
  
 - Sharing of exploratory analysis done in previous week
 
 - Proposal of new question (which season is the best to connducct training in?).
   - Cleaned data will be grouped into seasons
   - Air traffic control data can be used to determine best times for training sessions (less air traffic = less likely to have collision/accident).
   
 - Resolves to have concrete questions, visualizations, and examples (This will be discussed at the next meeting)
 
 - Start generating project proposal based off first two meetings `It's better to have too much and have to whittle it down than too little and scramble to write more`

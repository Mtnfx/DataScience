# Data Files

### Initial Data
- Unedited initial source data from RStudio Cloud proposal project

### Clean Data
- Has every data point both complete and incomplete with as much fixing as was possible

### Complete Clean Data
- Has only complete fixed data points. Any unfixable data points were deleted (~10)

### Extra Analysis
- Just a couple graphs mapping correlation between session time and number of exercises completed in the session

### Clean Data Sta
- This is what preprocess_complete_data.R outputs when it writes to a csv file `Note that this program does not auto write a csv file. I manually input the command to write csv since when modifying data, we probably don't need a csv file outputted`

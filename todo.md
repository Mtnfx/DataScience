# To Do
- Answer 3 questions
  1. Do longer sessions guarantee better training? `Based on some preliminary Excel work, it appears the opposite is actually true (see Alec's Excel graphs)`
  2. Does student performance vary with aircraft types?
  3. Compare efficiency of aircrafts
  
- Ask client about outlying data points (odd years, unclear training exercise numbers missing commas)

- Clean all data (or as much as possible) `Only one exercise set and several missing seesion durations remain to be fixed`

## Project Proposal
- Specify questions addressed
